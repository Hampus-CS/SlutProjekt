  lore: Garok hails from the rugged highlands, where conflict was life and survival
    meant mastering combat. His unmatched strength and valor made him a legend among
    warriors, but betrayal by his clan forced him into exile. Arriving in urban battlegrounds
    as a wandering mercenary, Garok quickly dominated the street fighting scene through
    sheer resilience and masterful weaponry. Known as "The Iron Guardian," his brute
    strength and relentless style have carved a legend into the stone-cobbled streets,
    inspiring awe and dread in every fight he enters.
