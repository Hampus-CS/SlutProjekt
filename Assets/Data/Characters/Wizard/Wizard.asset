  lore: Raizel, once a respected scholar within the mystical citadel of Arkalis,
    spent decades studying the chaotic power of storms. After a disastrous experiment
    to harness lightning itself resulted in the destruction of his beloved academy,
    Raizel was exiled, branded a reckless outcast. Wandering through shadowy city
    streets, he refined his craft, mastering lightning in its purest form. Now, as
    a feared combatant in underground street battles, Raizel channels his rage into
    electrifying orbs, striking opponents with searing precision and earning the
    title "Storm Sage."
