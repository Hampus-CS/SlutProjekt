  lore: Born amidst the volcanic spires of the distant Ember Isles, Sylvara possessed
    an innate affinity for fire magic. Shunned by villagers fearful of her uncontrollable
    powers, she traveled from city to city, hiding among the crowded slums. Street
    combat became her path to acceptance; every match was an opportunity to control
    and master her fiery gift. Sylvara's blazing fireballs have since become legendary,
    illuminating the darkest alleys as crowds chant the name of the feared yet revered
    "Flame Seer."
